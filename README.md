# Stonix
Stonix is a hobby project of mine. I want to create my own small AI named Stonix.
For those who are interested, the name is simply a technical version of my username.

# Stonix-Vision
Stonix Vision is the image recognition branch of Stonix.
I’m also working on a chat version of Stonix: [Stonix PSL](https://github.com/Stoniye/Stonix-PSL)

# Perzeptron Model
The Perzeptron model is essentially a simple image recognition model — more like a "Yes/No" classifier.
I pre-trained an example using pixel data for red and green, so it can now differentiate whether a pixel is red or green.

# Softmax Model
The Softmax Model is a more complex model I'm currently developing.
My plan is to train it on pixel data so it can differentiate between white, black, green, red, blue, and yellow.
Eventually, I want to be able to upload an image, and have Stonix predict the dominant color.
